#### Final Project - NBA Statistics

### Project Outline

This project aims to analyse team and player statistics and predict the outcome of regular-season games. A regression model will be used to predict teams that will make it to the playoffs. The ultimate goal is to predict the team that will take home the championship.

### Data

Data will be taken from the official statistics published by the NBA at [www.nba.com/stats](www.nba.com/stats). In case supplemental information is needed, data can also be taken from [www.basketball-reference.com](www.basketball-reference.com).

### Approach

A linear regression model will be used to predict team performance based on the statistics of each team's top 7 players.

A logistic regression model will then be applied on the team performance to predict which team will win a matchup. The results of the prediction will be stored in a table and will be used to map out the rest of the season.

Predictions can be rerun as needed.
